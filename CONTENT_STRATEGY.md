## Writing Tips

### Make It Unique

**Instead of:** "Mumbai is a beautiful city with many attractions."

**Write:** "Standing at Marine Drive at 6 AM, watching Mumbai wake up with the Arabian Sea breeze in your face, you'll understand why this city never sleeps. From the street vendors setting up chai stalls to early morning joggers, the energy is palpable."

### Add Personal Experience

**Generic:** "The Gateway of India is a popular monument."

**Personal:** "I visited the Gateway of India at sunset, and despite the crowds, managed to capture some stunning photos. Pro tip: Visit on a weekday morning before 8 AM for fewer tourists and better light."

### Be Specific

**Vague:** "There are many good restaurants."

**Specific:** "Try Karim's near Jama Masjid (established 1913) for authentic Mughlai food. Their mutton seekh kebab (₹280) and roomali roti (₹30) are legendary. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes during lunch hours."

### Use Conversational Tone

**Formal:** "One should visit the aforementioned locations."

**Conversational:** "Trust me, you don't want to miss these spots! I've been to Delhi five times, and these places never disappoint."
