  "description": "Goa is located on the country's western coast and is scattered over just 3702 km.\n\nBesides being the smallest state, the city is the most prominent tourist place, trendy for its beauty and the season all around the year. The beaches and clubs of this city are occupied by not only foreigners but also by Indian people as it's a pocket-friendly place for doing a party.\n\nThe city is known for its cheapest alcohol which attracts a lot of youngsters there. Indian heaven, known for nature's beauty of seas, greenery, and peaceful areas, is divided into two sides: North and South. The north region is most famous for the best pubs, clubs, and nightfall areas. Whereas the south part is best for the people who love peace, it's the costlier one.",
